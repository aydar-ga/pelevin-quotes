## About 📖

This is my pet-project inspired by reading Victor Pelevin's works. I wanted to create a parallel universe of his books that would retain the Pelevin's literary spirit: i.e. witty satirical takes on our life. I have no doubts that some literary critics would note that the very essence of this project is partly a reflection of the slightly changed nature (sic!) of Pelevin's work in recent years. Viktor Olegovich, please don't take offense 😉

## Current project status ✔️

I wanted to have a minimalist web-site where you can get tease your literature taste. Foolproof simple as AK-47: hit the button and the machine will give you a new dose.

## Planned product enhancements 🏁

I'm planning to implement these changes:

- save your favourite punchlines
- be able to contribute your versions of punchlines
- have an option to categorise your punchlines
- vote for your favourites
- some UI sugar etc ...

## Technical setup 🤖

- Next.js & Vercel & Supabase
- GitHub Actions
- Playwright
